[{"content":"Recently, I tried to build a blog and deployed it directly on github. This article will briefly explain how to approach it.\nGithub Repository First, we need to have a github account. If you donâ€™t have one yet, please register one. Create a new repository named [username].github.io in github. If you want to use Github Pages that github supports by default, please select a Jekyll theme through project \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Github Pages \u0026gt; Choose a theme. Then edit the contents of index.md and submit the changes. Your own website is ready now! Static Website Generator In addition to Jekyll, there are many other static page generators. Here is a brief comparison and summary of the following three static page generators as well as their characteristics.\nHugo: Written in Go Super fast github stared 70k Jekyll Written in Ruby Built-in support for Github pages github stared 47k Hexo Written in Node.js Supporting Chinese github stared 37k As a backend engineer, I\u0026rsquo;ll just choose Hugo for beginning. We can figure out their differences later.\nHugo \u0026amp; PaperMod Quick Start First, follow the steps and install Hugo brew install hugo Create a new project by Hugo hugo new site \u0026lt;name of site\u0026gt; --format yaml cd \u0026lt;name of site\u0026gt; Find a concise and good-looking theme you like. This time I used PaperMod (It could also be added via submodule) git clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1 For update\ncd themes/PaperMod git pull Modify the theme in the configuration file config.yml theme: \u0026#34;PaperMod\u0026#34; We might need to spend a little bit time to learn how to config for PaperMod. This time I directly downloaded its demo and made some modifications. Let\u0026rsquo;s run it first.\nAdd Content Generate an md file by the following command and edit it.\nhugo new content [PATH_TO_NEW_POST].md If you have never written a markdown document, please google for it and I believe you would be familiar with it quickly.\nRun in local environment Start the server in your local environment by the following command. The default address would be http://localhost:1313/\nhugo server If you want confirm your drafts, please use the following commands\nhugo server --buildDrafts hugo server -D Publish the site When you publish your site, Hugo creates the entire static site in the public directory in the root of your project.\nhugo Deployment After confirming the contents, submit the project to your [username].github.io repository. The next step is to deploy it. Deploying the main branch directly in Github Pages would not work. We need to add a github workflow.\nPlease refer: actions-hugo\nAdd the following content to .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\nname: github pages on: push: branches: - main # Set a branch to deploy jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#34;0.121.1\u0026#34; # extended: true - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public After adding the file, Github Actions will automatically execute when the codes are submitted to the main branch, and the generated static pages will be submitted to gh-pages branch. It should be noted here that by default, Github Actions might have no permissions to modify and create branches. We need to update permissions in project \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Actions \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Workflow permissions.\nFinally, select gh-pages branch in the configuration of Github Pages and deploy it. Now the whole process is completed.\nEnjoy your own site!\nLicense Copyright 2023-present Wenshan.\n","permalink":"https://zhangwenshan001.github.io/posts/papermod/build-my-blog-by-hugo/","summary":"This article records the process of building this blog by Hugo \u0026amp; PaperMod theme \u0026amp; github actions","title":"Building my own blog by Hugo"}]
